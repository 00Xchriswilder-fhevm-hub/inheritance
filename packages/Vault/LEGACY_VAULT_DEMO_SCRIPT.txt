Legacy Vault – Demo Talk Track (Google Meet via Luma)
====================================================

[You can trim or rewrite anything in here. This is written as if you’re speaking live.]

----------------------------------------------------
1. Quick Personal Intro (30–60 seconds)
----------------------------------------------------

“Hey everyone, thanks so much for joining today.

My name is [YOUR NAME], and I’m the creator of Legacy Vault.

Today I want to talk about something we almost never enjoy talking about:
what happens to our digital life and our wealth if something happens to us –
and then I’ll show you how Legacy Vault helps solve that in a very practical way.”

[Pause – let people settle.]

----------------------------------------------------
2. The Human Problem (2–3 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“Let me start with a simple, uncomfortable question:

If you disappeared tomorrow – an accident, an illness, whatever – 
would the people you love actually be able to access what you’ve built?

Your crypto, your important files, your accounts, your instructions… 
or would all of that die with you?”

[Short pause.]

“Most of us have the same pattern:
- We have seed phrases written on paper somewhere.
- Passwords saved in browsers, password managers, or just in our heads.
- Maybe a will that’s out of date or hard to execute.

And in crypto especially, there’s this harsh reality:
if your private keys are gone, they’re gone. 
There’s no ‘Forgot Password’ button for your wallet.

So we end up in this weird tension:
- On one hand, we want strong security. 
  We don’t want anyone touching our assets while we’re alive.
- On the other hand, we don’t want our family locked out forever if something happens.

And because it’s uncomfortable, we procrastinate.
We say, ‘I’ll write that down later. I’ll set up a plan later.’
And later often never comes.”

----------------------------------------------------
3. Why Existing Solutions Are Broken (1–2 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“Let’s look quickly at what people usually do:

- Password-based systems:
  You write things down, you share a password or a seed with someone you trust.
  That can get lost, stolen, copied, or misused.

- Multi-sig wallets:
  Great idea in theory, but they require multiple people to coordinate.
  And they don’t really solve, ‘What if I’m gone and my family isn’t crypto-native?’

- Trusted third parties:
  Lawyers, custodians, centralized services.
  You’re basically saying: ‘Here, hold my secrets and don’t screw this up.’
  That’s a huge point of failure and a big trust assumption.

- Plain encryption:
  You can encrypt a backup, but at some point you have to reveal the key 
  to the person you want to help – which means they can access it any time, 
  not just when you’re gone.

All of these approaches force you to choose between:
security while you’re alive, and access for your loved ones when you’re not.

Legacy Vault is about not having to choose.”

----------------------------------------------------
4. What Legacy Vault Is (High-Level) (1–2 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“So what is Legacy Vault?

Legacy Vault is a time-locked, cryptographically enforced inheritance vault.

You can think of it as:
‘A secure digital vault where I can store secrets and wealth-related data,
 choose exactly who can access it, 
 and set a time or condition for when they can unlock it – 
 all enforced by math and cryptography, not trust.’

Concretely, it lets you:
- Store encrypted data (like an AES key, seed phrase, or any critical secret).
- Add one or more heirs – their wallet addresses.
- Set a release timestamp in the future.
- While you’re alive and before that time, only you can unlock it.
- After that time, your authorized heirs can unlock – but only the people you chose.

And you can always:
- Update the release time.
- Add or remove heirs.
- Even revoke access before the release time if something changes.

You stay in control, but you also give your loved ones a guaranteed path to access.”

----------------------------------------------------
5. The Core Magic – In Human Terms (2–3 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“Under the hood, Legacy Vault uses something called Fully Homomorphic Encryption – FHE –
plus an access control system (ACL).

Let me explain that in normal language.

Imagine you put your secret – for example your AES key – into a vault.
But instead of the app or the smart contract ever seeing that key in plain text,
it’s stored as an encrypted number on-chain.

With FHE, the smart contract can ‘work with’ that encrypted value
without ever decrypting it.

On top of that, we have an ACL – Access Control List.
When you create a vault, the system says:
‘This encrypted key can be decrypted by this specific address – yours.’

When you add an heir, the system says:
‘This encrypted key can also be decrypted by this heir’s address –
 but only after the release time.’

So instead of trusting a company or a lawyer, 
you’re literally trusting math:
- The ACL defines who can decrypt.
- The time lock defines when they can decrypt.
- The encrypted value itself never appears in plain text on-chain.

Even the contract owner can’t just peek into your key.
ACL plus FHE gives you:
wallet-based access, time-locked release, and confidentiality in one system.”

----------------------------------------------------
6. Real-Life Scenarios (Storytelling) (3–4 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“Let me make this real with a few scenarios.

Scenario 1: The Accident
------------------------
You might be thinking:
‘What if I die in a car accident tomorrow?’

With Legacy Vault, you’ve already created a vault.
You’ve chosen your heirs – maybe your partner, your children, a sibling.
You’ve set a release time, maybe a year out, maybe tied to a specific date.

Until that release time, even though they’re authorized,
they cannot decrypt that secret.
They can’t front-run you, they can’t drain you while you’re alive.

But if something happens to you and enough time passes,
the system does what it’s designed to do:
your heirs can unlock and recover what you left for them.
No chasing lawyers, no guessing passwords, no reading your mind.”


“Scenario 2: The Lost Phrase
----------------------------
Another very real scenario:
‘What if I lose my recovery phrase?’

With Legacy Vault, the vault itself becomes your backup.
Your encrypted data – your AES key, your recovery material –
is stored securely (for example backed by IPFS in the background).

As the owner, you can always unlock your own vault.
So you’re not just planning for death; 
you’re also planning for very human mistakes we all make.”


“Scenario 3: The Trust Issue
----------------------------
You might say:
‘I want my family to have access if I’m gone,
 but I’m afraid they’ll take everything while I’m alive.’

Legacy Vault’s answer is simple:
they can’t – because of the time lock.

You can grant access to their addresses,
but until the release timestamp you choose,
the system will not allow them to decrypt.

You get to say:
‘Yes, you will have access… but not yet.’”


“Scenario 4: The Multi-Heir Family
----------------------------------
Now imagine you have, say, three children.
You don’t want drama, you don’t want one person being the gatekeeper.

With Legacy Vault, you can simply grant access to all three addresses.
Each one gets their own permission through the ACL.

After the release time, they can each unlock independently.
No one is stuck waiting on the other.
It’s fair, it’s transparent, and the rules are enforced by code.”

----------------------------------------------------
7. Transition to Live Demo (30–60 seconds)
----------------------------------------------------

“Okay, that’s the big picture. 
Now let me show you how this actually feels in the app.

I’ll share my screen,
walk you through creating a legacy vault,
adding heirs, setting a release time,
and then we’ll look at what the experience is like 
for an heir trying to unlock after the release time.”

[Now you share screen and switch to the app.]

----------------------------------------------------
8. Live Demo Flow (You Adapt to Your UI) (5–10 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

[You can use this as a rough checklist while you click through.]

1) Create a New Vault
---------------------
“Here on the main screen, I’m going to create a new Legacy Vault.

I give it a name – for example ‘Family Crypto Backup’ –
and here’s where I provide the secret: this could be an AES key,
it could be a seed phrase, or any other data we want to protect.”

[Type something realistic but safe for demo.]

“Notice that I never store this in plain text on-chain.
It’s encrypted and handled through FHE behind the scenes.”


2) Add Heirs (Wallet Addresses)
-------------------------------
“Next, I’m going to add a couple of heirs.
Let’s say I add two addresses – maybe representing two children.

Each of these addresses is now authorized in the ACL
to eventually decrypt this vault – but not yet.”


3) Set the Release Time
-----------------------
“Now I choose a release time.
For the demo, I might set something close in the future just to simulate,
but in real life you might choose a date like:
‘1 year from now’, or a specific date in the future.

Until this timestamp is reached,
only I, as the owner, can unlock this vault.

After that timestamp,
the heirs I’ve added will be able to unlock from their own wallets.”


4) Show Owner Control (Update / Revoke)
---------------------------------------
“If I change my mind,
I can come back and:
- adjust the release time,
- add a new heir,
- or revoke an heir’s access before the release time.

So you’re not locked into a decision you made years ago.
Life changes, and your plan can change with it.”


5) Simulate Heir Experience (Conceptually)
------------------------------------------
[Here, either actually connect with a test heir wallet or just explain it.]

“Now let’s look at the heir’s side.

From their wallet, they see that they’re an authorized heir on this vault.

- If the release time has NOT passed:
  they can try to unlock, but the system will reject it.
  The time lock and ACL are doing their job.

- Once the release time is reached:
  their wallet can request decryption,
  and the system will allow it – because the conditions are met.

That’s the key idea:
I don’t need to be alive to ‘approve’ anything.
The rules were set in advance and are enforced automatically.”

----------------------------------------------------
9. Wrap-Up & Vision (1–2 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“To summarize:

- We all have digital assets and secrets that matter.
- The current ways we handle inheritance and backup are fragile:
  papers, passwords, people we have to trust.
- Legacy Vault lets you define:
  *what* gets inherited,
  *who* gets access,
  and *when* they get it –
  without exposing your keys while you’re alive.

It combines:
- wallet-based authentication,
- time-locked release,
- and strong encryption with FHE and ACLs,
to give you a safer, more predictable way
to pass on what you’ve built.”

“My goal with Legacy Vault is simple:
make it normal – and easy – 
for crypto users and digital natives
to have a serious, robust inheritance plan,
without needing to become security experts or lawyers.”

----------------------------------------------------
10. Call to Action / Q&A (1–3 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------

“If this resonates with you,
I’d love for you to:
- Try out the app.
- Think about who you would actually add as heirs.
- And send me feedback on what you’d need 
  for this to become part of your real-life planning.

I’ll pause here for questions.
Happy to go deeper into the tech, 
talk about edge cases,
or walk through specific scenarios you’re worried about.”

[End.]
