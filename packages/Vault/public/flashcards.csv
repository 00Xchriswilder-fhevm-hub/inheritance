What is the primary purpose of Legacy Vault?,"To secure digital legacy with time-locked encryption, ensuring assets are passed down safely at the designated time."
"What is the core problem that solutions for digital legacy currently face, leading to permanent asset loss?","Existing solutions are fragmented, insecure, and often lead to permanent asset loss."
"What happens to crypto assets if private keys are lost or forgotten, a problem categorized as 'Lost Access'?",The wallets become mathematically inaccessible forever.
Why is 'No Inheritance' a major problem for digital assets?,"Traditional legal frameworks struggle with digital assets, and courts cannot force a blockchain to transfer funds without automated processes."
"What security hole is created by sharing keys with lawyers or family members, a problem referred to as 'Trust Issues'?",It creates a massive security hole with a high risk of theft or misuse before death.
What is the 'Time Pressure' problem in digital asset inheritance?,Delays in probate can lead to missed market opportunities or permanent loss of assets that need to be accessed at a precise moment.
Why do traditional password-based methods for digital inheritance often fail?,"They are susceptible to phishing, memory loss, and brute force attacks; if you forget it, it's gone forever."
What is the main drawback of using multi-sig wallets for digital inheritance?,They are extremely complex for non-technical heirs and require coordination between multiple parties who may not be available.
"According to the presentation, why is relying on trusted 3rd parties for digital inheritance a liability?","They are vulnerable to legal seizure, bankruptcy of the provider, or internal corruption."
What is the key failure of 'Plain Encryption' as a solution for digital inheritance?,"It offers static security with no mechanism for automatic release over time (like a dead man's switch), requiring manual intervention."
What core technology does Legacy Vault use to secure a user's digital afterlife?,Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
The Legacy Vault solution is powered by what underlying protocol?,The ZAMA PROTOCOL.
What key security feature of Legacy Vault ensures maximum protection through two layers of cryptographic security?,"Double Encryption: AES-256-GCM and FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)."
Legacy Vault's _____ feature ensures data is revealed only when specific temporal conditions are met.,Time-locked Access
What is the benefit of Legacy Vault's 'Confidential Keys' feature?,Keys remain hidden even during active computation.
How does Legacy Vault ensure verifiable access control?,"ZAMA ACL (Access Control List) and a blockchain-based immutable ledger."
What technology does Legacy Vault use for decentralized and redundant storage?,IPFS Storage.
What is the first step in the 3-step process of securing your legacy with LegacyLock?,"Create Vault: Upload files securely or enter text, and choose time-lock conditions. AES-256-GCM encryption is automatically applied."
"What is the second step in the 3-step LegacyLock process, which involves beneficiaries?","Grant Access: Designate beneficiary wallet addresses and grant them cryptographic access permissions via the blockchain."
"What key feature of Legacy Vault ensures that data remains encrypted even during processing, preventing any leaks?",FHE Encryption (Fully Homomorphic Encryption).
The ability to set specific future dates or trigger conditions for when data becomes accessible to heirs is called _____.,Time-Locked Release
"What feature allows for the secure distribution of access keys to multiple beneficiaries, executors, or family members?",Multi-Heir Support.
What does the 'Owner Control' feature in Legacy Vault allow the owner to do?,Retain the full ability to revoke or modify access rights anytime before the release condition is met.
What principle ensures that the Legacy Vault platform operators never have access to your unencrypted data or keys?,Zero Trust.
"Besides crypto assets, what other types of information can be stored in Legacy Vault, according to the 'File & Text Support' feature?","Varied assets including legal documents, passwords, and personal notes."
What is the specified encryption standard mentioned in the slides for encrypting vault contents?,AES-256-GCM.
"Under the 'Unlock as owner or heir' demo feature, when do heirs gain access to the vault's contents?","Heirs gain access only after maturity (i.e., the release conditions are met)."
