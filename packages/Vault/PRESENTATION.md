# 🔐 Legacy Vault
### Secure your digital legacy with time-locked encryption

**Powered by ZAMA Protocol**

## Slide 2: The Problem

### What happens to your crypto if something happens to you?

- ❌ **Lost access:** Recovery phrases forgotten or lost
- ❌ **No inheritance:** Family can't access your digital assets
- ❌ **Trust issues:** Can't share keys while you're alive
- ❌ **Time pressure:** Need secure, time-locked access control

**The digital inheritance problem Web3 has been ignoring.**

## Slide 3: Why Traditional Solutions Fail

### Current approaches don't work:

- ❌ **Password-based systems:** Can be lost, forgotten, or stolen
- ❌ **Multi-sig wallets:** Require multiple parties available simultaneously
- ❌ **Trusted third parties:** Centralized points of failure
- ❌ **Plain encryption:** Keys must be revealed to grant access

**Traditional encryption can't compute on encrypted data.**

## Slide 4: Our Solution

#  Legacy Vault

### Powered by ZAMA Protocol's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

- ✅ **Double encryption:** AES-256-GCM + FHE encryption layers
- ✅ **Time-locked access:** Cryptographically enforced release dates
- ✅ **Confidential keys:** Keys never revealed, even to authorized parties
- ✅ **Blockchain-based:** Decentralized, no single point of failure
- ✅ **IPFS storage:** Encrypted files stored on decentralized network

**Your keys stay confidential. Forever.**

## Slide 5: How It Works

### Simple 3-step process:

1. **Create Vault**
   - Encrypt data with AES-256-GCM
   - Encrypt AES key with FHE (via ZAMA)
   - Store on IPFS + Ethereum blockchain

2. **Grant Access**
   - Authorize heir wallet addresses
   - Set release timestamp
   - FHE Access Control Lists (ACL) manage permissions

3. **Unlock**
   - Owner: Access anytime
   - Heirs: Access after release time
   - Automatic decryption via FHEVM

**No passwords. No trust required. Just your wallet.**
